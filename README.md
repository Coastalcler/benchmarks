# Essential Guide to keep up with AI/ML/CV/UNameIt

These fields are booming these days. In order not to become rusty, one has to constantly follow the updates. Here is the essential guide on how to keep up with the important news/papers/discussions/tutorials. This guide is by no means an exhaustive one so contributions are truly welcome. I believe you have a lot to add!

## Connect to your local communities

Temporary description: From my personal experience, due to multiple reaons, there are various local communities(e.g. per counry). I would simply not dare include links for those that I am not competent in. Eventually, the table below might look smth like [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/29/5d/22/295d22ab9d9d2c35468b526459d687e8.jpg)(just an idea). Please update the table with verified links.
